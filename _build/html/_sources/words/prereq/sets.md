# Sets


Never briefly, a \textit{set} is collection of things (called elements) that share some property. We write sets between $\{$ and $\}$. For example, $\{a, b, c, ..., z\}$ is the set of lowercase letters. Some more important examples:


    \begin{equation} \text{The set of natural numbers } \NN = \{0, 1, 2, ...\} \end{equation}
    \begin{equation} \text{The set of integers } \ZZ= \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\} \end{equation}
    \begin{equation} \text{The set of positive rational numbers } \QQ^+ = \{1/2, 1/3, ...\} \end{equation}
    
    And so on. If $a$ is an element of a set $A$, we write $a \in A$. Sometimes, sets share elements. For example, $\NN$ and $\ZZ$ both contain $0$. If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A \cap B$ is the set of all the shared elements of $A$ and $B$, called the \textit{intersection}. For example, $\ZZ \cap \QQ = \NN$. 
    
    
    Intersection has a dual operation called \textit{union} and written $A \cup B$ which gives you the set of elements that are either in $A$ or $B$ (as opposed to both). So if $EVEN$ is the set of even integers and $ODD$ is the set of odd integers, then $EVEN \cup ODD = \ZZ$. 
    
    
    
    Finally, if all the elements of one set are also in another set, we write $A \subseteq B$ and say $A$ is a \textit{subset} of $B$. If there's some $a \in A$ that's \textit{not} in $B$, then $A \not\subseteq B$. For example, $\NN \subseteq \ZZ$ but $\ZZ \not\subseteq \QQ^+$. Try and work out whether its true that $A \cap B \subseteq A \subseteq A \cup B$ (or vice-versa).
    
    
    
    A trick for remembering the difference between $\cap$ and $\cup$ is that $\cap$ sort of looks like an N and you can sort of think of the elements of $A \cap B$ as the elements of ``A aNd B'', meanwhile $\cup$ sort of looks like a U and you can sort of read $A \cup B$ as ``A Uor B''...
